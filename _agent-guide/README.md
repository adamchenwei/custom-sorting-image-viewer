# Get Started

# Start Building
add your inputs:
  - add your inputs in app-user-input/current-user-input.md
  - add your assets in app-user-input/current-user-assets folder

# Update Agent Guide Itself
ask agent to start the app building process via start.md or ask the agent to sync latest version of agent-guide via sync.md by calling the sync.md file in the /agentic-guide folder so it will start the process to update the local agentic-guide folder within a project. The sync process will preserve your existing user inputs and assets while updating the underlying agent guide structure. This ensures that your custom configurations and assets are maintained during updates, allowing you to keep your project-specific settings while benefiting from the latest agent guide improvements.
