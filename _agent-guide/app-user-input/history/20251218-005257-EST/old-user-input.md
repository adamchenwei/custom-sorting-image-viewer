dark mode is weird. fix it, you an see some text is not even showing when its not hovered and color in consistency. make sure it does not break light theme if you do apply and fix. its the /results page http://localhost:3099/results?startDate=2022-12-18&endDate=2025-12-18&startTime=07%3A25&endTime=07%3A40&weeks=Thursday&includeAllYears=true
