This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Scripts

This project includes custom scripts to help with development and file management.

### Count Files in a Directory

To count the total number of files in a specific folder, you can use the `get-total-files-count` script. This is useful for verifying the contents of a directory before or after an operation.

**Usage:**

```bash
npm run get-total-files-count -- /path/to/your/folder
```

### Permanently Delete a Folder

To permanently delete a folder and all of its contents, use the `delete-folder` script. This action is irreversible, so please use it with caution.

**Usage:**

```bash
npm run delete-folder -- /path/to/your/folder
```
