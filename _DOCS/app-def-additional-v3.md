      1. I want to add a new functionality. a delete button on each list item. it should be align to the right of each item. it should looks like a close button symbol. use existing library to achieve it. the delete button will perform an actual delete operation on the image itself in the /public/images folder in the app. create new api endpoint as needed and any server services as needed. make them reusable. provide example and documentations
      2. the deletion only happened to the json entry. I want to also actually delete the file in the public/images folder with the file name associated
      3.

3. move button on each list item (move from /public/images to /public/images/zoomed-in) 
4. new display mode allow multiple selected images overlap and need allow multiple select on the list
