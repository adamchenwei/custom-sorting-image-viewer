Additional Personal Surge Data Collected END


Example of Bad Response BEG:

i.e. 
"Begin shifting toward evening dinner and entertainment areas" this for Next Hour Direction is NOT specific enough, they need to be a specific location with a name on map, so I can navigate to it and under Next Hour Direction.
"Hotels throughout the region" not specific enough, at least mention the region name.
"Hotels in Jupiter & Palm Beach Gardens" is not specific enough, put up which hotels.

General- 
Do not drive later than 1a and make sure keep 6 hours rest applied till 7a. Otherwise risk missing big surged morning and early afternoon. Also result in very bad catch sleep and mental power decline tremendously and potentially affect 3 days after Saturday. Very very NOT worth it. DO NOT DRIVE after 1AM.
