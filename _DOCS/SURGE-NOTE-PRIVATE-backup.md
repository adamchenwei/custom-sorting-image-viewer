Thursday before Christmas is HUGE PARTY DAY NIGHT SUPER HIGH SURGE JUPITER LOVE STREET 
NEVER DROP EARLY. ALWAYS GO TO THE ORIGINAL DROP SPOT EVEN DROP EARLY TO EARN FULL AMOUNT 
The day after Christmas (25th) can be SUPER DEAD WHOLE DAY afternoon! 
Sunday after 7p don't even try. It's dead
The day post thanks giving day WHOLE DAY DEAD! DON'T EVEN TRY! Also dead the Saturday and Sunday! Don't even think work Uber
If you stop getting a ride for more than 30 seconds 30 minutes when you are in the surge it likely is that something's broken with your right capture so you have to cancel the surge and restart to get offline and get back online again to be able to receive rides again 
Is a very very very bad idea to head to Jupiter farm for a ride around 8:00 a.m. because You are likely get stuck in the traffic to reenter Jupiter area for the rush hour especially during the week
TURN ON AIRPLANE MODE then leave the phone at that state(as well as turn on power saving) it will help you retain your surge while also not getting trip!!!!!! I got it retained over night!!!! At app version 4.497.10001 ... Or maybe not? Had to try this again to see the long or short duration impact
When check off different ride types, your surge can be reduced or removed to the least surge or not at all.
When the surge is not a cluster but a single explosion is absolutely not wise to pursue it if it is 10 minute or more away even a minute is really risky says he can't just disappear right before you enter it 
Miami 5p when jump on i95, it's worth it to pay the extra 1 dollar to pass the Miami area traffic which can be long and bad.
Weird things 
Admiral Cove and Bear Club surges are high but many time no rides for more than 20m with the Cass saw q surge in place, also Internet at Bear's club bad

Additional Personal Surge Data Collected END


Example of Bad Response BEG:

i.e. 
"Begin shifting toward evening dinner and entertainment areas" this for Next Hour Direction is NOT specific enough, they need to be a specific location with a name on map, so I can navigate to it and under Next Hour Direction.
"Hotels throughout the region" not specific enough, at least mention the region name.
"Hotels in Jupiter & Palm Beach Gardens" is not specific enough, put up which hotels.

SAT
General- 
Do not drive later than 1a and make sure keep 6 hours rest applied till 7a. Otherwise risk missing big surged morning and early afternoon. Also result in very bad catch sleep and mental power decline tremendously and potentially affect 3 days after Saturday. Very very NOT worth it. DO NOT DRIVE after 1AM.
