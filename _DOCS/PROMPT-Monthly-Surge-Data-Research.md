Can you list out all the potential rideshare surge hot spots in Jupiter and Palm Beach Gardens for Sepetember and Ocotorber? I want very very detailed list in json format and have coordinate and location name in each object of the list. make sure add head count as a variable indicating how many people will likely present during those specific day, and time periods.

an example of the object for the json looks like one in planner data file of /Users/adamchenwei/www/custom-sorting-image-viewer/public/planner-data/2025.json
